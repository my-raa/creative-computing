>“Anything you think of doing, however insignificant, should be done immediately. Spur yourself on and carry it through without becoming discouraged. If this becomes an ingrained habit, things you thought were impossible will become possible, and closed doors will open, as you will discover in many ways.” 

― Shinichi Suzuki, Nurtured by Love: The Classic Approach to Talent Education

Suzuki was a great musician and teacher who believed that "**ability** is not an **inborn talent**, but an ability which can be developed", which I resonated a lot with during this project. We may not feel as though everything comes naturally to us, however it's the process that ends up making it worth while once accomplished.

Through learning about creative computing, I understood the value that **open source** has in the accessibility to knowledge and power that coding and computing has in educating the next generation of creators.
