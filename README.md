  >‚ÄúAnything you think of doing, however insignificant, should be done immediately. Spur yourself on and carry it through without becoming discouraged. If this becomes an ingrained habit, things you thought were impossible will become possible, and closed doors will open, as you will discover in many ways.‚Äù 

**‚Äï Shinichi Suzuki**, Nurtured by Love: *The Classic Approach to Talent Education*

Suzuki was a great musician and teacher who believed that "**ability** is not an **inborn talent**, but an ability which can be developed". We may not feel as though everything comes naturally to us, however it's the process that ends up making it worth while once accomplished.

Through learning about creative computing, I understood the value that **open source** has in the accessibility to knowledge and power that coding and computing created in educating the next generation. So as a response, this READ.ME file will provide you with everything that you need to know to start your journey in programming and coding. ü§ì

## Github

**Github** is a collaborative open source software, where users can build, and edit software development as a community, through **README** files.

## Repositories

- A digital hub for user project files, where the file history can be tracked, revised, edited and saved.

## README File

- A **text file** that informs users with all the information, instructions, or updates about softwares and projects.
  
  ## TinkerCAD & Arduino

> - **Arduino** is an **open source** platform and user community that is designed to increase accessibility for electronics and build environments.
  
> - **TinkerCAD** is an online program that anyone can access to experiment and learn 3D modelling. This is a very useful resource for anyone that wants to experiment with new mediums, such as  **Arduino**, as they have multiple tutorials on their platform to educate users as well as encourage them to explore the resource itself.

## Open Source 

  - When a software code is made available for distribution and contribution on a platform.

## Markdown Syntax

- **Markdown** is a plain format language used for coding that can be easily converted into text. The *syntax* is the **markdown guide** that explains everything from how to upload emojis, üòÇ creating **headings** and `URL links`.
